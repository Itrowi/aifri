```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Create a `.env` file** with your API keys
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
NCBI_API_KEY=your_ncbi_api_key_here
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-for-sessions
```

5. **Run the application**
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```
OPENAI_API_KEY        # Your OpenAI API key for GPT responses

```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This application is for educational purposes only. The information provided is NOT a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for medical concerns.

### Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:
1. Change the `SECRET_KEY` in your `.env` file
2. Use environment variables for all sensitive data
3. Enable HTTPS
4. Set `DEBUG=False` in production
5. Use a production-grade ASGI server (e.g., Gunicorn)
6. Implement proper rate limiting and request validation
7. Add database storage for user sessions instead of in-memory

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key" Error
- Verify your OpenAI and NCBI API keys are correct
- Check that they're properly set in the `.env` file

### "No Results Found"
- Try a different search term
- Ensure your internet connection is working
- Check that NCBI API is accessible

### Login Issues
- Make sure you're using the correct username/password
- Clear your browser cache and try again
- Check that sessions middleware is properly configured
